Overview
Developed a Transformer-based model dedicated to addressing sentiment analysis challenges. 
This innovative approach leverages the strength of advanced neural network architectures to accurately interpret and analyze emotions expressed in text.

Model Training and Fine-tuning
Models undergoes a comprehensive training process, employing the same datasets used by widely recognized large language models (LLM), such as the BERT model.
